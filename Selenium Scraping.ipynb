It is affordable and sustainable as well. For the creators, great job! I have been using this app for 3 years and it hasn't failed me since. Suggestion though, create an extension that works like momentum, so the timer in my chrome won't go away when I click. Thanks!\",\n",
       "  1: \"Super cute and helpful! This has been helping me with my studying since I started using it - a lot of the time, I'll even go over the time I set for myself. I love seeing my little trees grow because I'm working hard! Having the reminders also helps to get me back into study mode. I really love this app!\",\n",
       "  2: \"I like this app and find it useful for concentrating on specific tasks for a designated period of time, during which a virtual tree grows. It's satisfying to see a forest / garden at the end of the day. My only problem with the app is that the selection of plants to choose from is not great. The more recent ones are nice and have a lot of detail, but the earlier ones are quite cartoonish and unappealing.\",\n",
       "  3: \"I've been using Forest since 2015 and it definitely helps prevent mindless usage of distracting apps. I consider paying for premium and other perks every so often a thank you to the developers for the many hours of productivity this app has helped me achieve. It's more than paid for itself. One feature I've found myself wanting lately would be to have custom app whitelists tied to the activity you've selected. So my work activity would be more strict than others for example.\",\n",
       "  4: \"so many bugs...so many bugs...even in pro version there are some irritating bugs. Like...when the screen is off,the tree will die. Sometimes when the screen is on, tree dies. Sometimes the sound won't work.\",\n",
       "  5: 'So much helpful.... A great app to deal with phone addiction. Now I am a premium user. Definitely, the developers are working hard. This is by far the most productive app on play store and I am increasing my productivity day by day with you guys. Looking forward to plant a real 🎄! Great job guys!',\n",
       "  6: 'This app is amazing. However, the devs have in the past removed features for free users in favour of making them paid. I currently am using the paid version, but for anyone using it free, just be aware of this. (Referring to the loss of app whitelisting in the free version)',\n",
       "  7: \"I would have given 5 stars, since this app is very helpful for concentrating! Only since the last update there seems to be a bug. I cannot see any statistics anymore, and none of my forests from the whole week or month. I can only see the actual day and when I try the other data's it's only loading forever but nothing happens. Can anyone help me with this?\",\n",
       "  8: \"Amazing App only had it for a few days and it's already helping with productivity. I would give it 5 stars however, when I go to start planting a tree I get a pop up saying I haven't allowed permissions for the app so I can't turn on deep focus. I have gone in settings and there is no permissions that I have turned off and no option to fix permissions directly in the app, make it a hastle. I Am looking to pay for the pro version, however there would be no point if I am unable to fix this issue.\",\n",

The graphics are cute and refreshing, and I like the idea of planting a tree (or plant) by spending my time doing productive stuff. That's really creative (I give 5 stars to that! ;) But sadly though, there are a lot of good features only pro-user can use. :'( For now, I'm only dissatisfied with that. Thanks! :)\",\n",
       "  10: \"A lot of the more intuitive features are locked behind a paywall, as well as actually helping real forests, which was the main appeal for me. The basic version gives you some cute trees, basic analytics and white noise options, and it works pretty well to keep you from looking at your phone and guiding you back to the app. It's a fine app if you're looking for a basic focus timer.\",\n",
       "  11: 'Nice app but the only thing irritates me is premiership. Any time i want explore the app its asks me to take premium orelse it wont open. I mean you can only use the timer nothing else without premiership. If i have to use only timer why should i waste my mobile storage on this app I can use other app. I request the publisher to give features without premiership',\n",
       "  12: 'Great App. However, there is a workaround. If on the lock screen I click on a whatsapp notification and then I am prompted to enter my password, I am bale to go directly into the app and that seems to by pass Forest. So maybe make that impossible to do and like increase the apps aggressiveness a bit? Otherwise no complaints love it!',\n",
       "  13: \"It's an ok app, but you can't play the ambient sounds while planting the tree, I had a sound unlocked but I could never play it while I studied, and some other advanced settings aren't easy to figure out either. Also, it would be nice to have at least a few achievements in the free version.\",\n",
       "  14: \"I really like this app so far! I do wish there were a few more choices for plants in the beginning, just so you can have them represent different tasks. Two is a little limited and it takes a lot of time (and focus!) to earn coins for other plants. But i guess that's also good motivation. Fun app for staying focused :)\",\n",
       "  15: 'I meet a problem while using the app.... In case of applying \"Allow List\" and using YouTube and then I select \" play video sound with screen off\" this feature is on new Xiaomi mobiles. What happens is ....the tree will be withered. I need you to solve this annoying problem',\n",
       "  16: \"I really like the idea of trees representing your focus hours. I even purchased the app so I can buy more tree species. But the app is so laggy. I have to press several time to change tags or tree types for example. The notification only works sometimes. And whenever I open the app, it's reloading instead of showing where I was last time. Sometimes my tree withers for no reasons. I really like the app so I hope future versions of the app will get better.\",\n",

       "  19: 'I have only been using this app for about a week now but it has already helped me focus on what I need to do. Also, I love the idea of the tree growing as I focus more on the important things. A really good app to build a habit of focusing.',\n",
       "  20: 'I am a long-time user of this app, but sometime in the last month, the \"plant together\" function has broken. I plant trees with my school friends a lot, and now all the trees I\\'ve ever planted as a group show up as dead. Another friend of mine is having the same problem, however an iPhone user friend is not having this problem. I hope they fix this issue, it is so sad to see all the trees I\\'ve planted together in this year turn to dead trees.',\n",
       "  21: \"Well I like the app and it truly helps me stay focused, combined with some time restriction methods it's good (although those ones are short times plus breaks), achievements are boring and not good enough, they try to make you pay for extra, but the app itself is not exciting enough to pay, the achievements are not really worth it and it's hard to unlock new trees even with pro version. No new campaigns are launched & collecting coins is not an easily achievable task, too hard to get new trees.\",\n",
       "  22: \"This app is literally the best focusing app, at least for me. It allows you to plant trees whenever you get focused. It's kinda like a game. Its not as boring as other focusing apps.\",\n",
       "  23: \"So much potential in one app. Adding interactions with the plants and trees just to relax or reflect, automatically setting a schedule to plant a tree and adding a pomodoro style timer are my suggestions. 4 stars because, somehow, I dislike the user interface especially the tags. It just doesn't suit ny tastes. Still great tho. Recommended for students⭐⭐⭐⭐\",\n",
       "  24: \"It does the job; not letting a plant die gives me enough incentive to not touch my phone. Also, I BOUGHT THE APP! If you are thinking of doing the same just to get trees, don't. You'd still need to earn coins to buy tree styles and you can't get time locked trees still!\",\n",
       "  25: 'Interesting way to gain focus. Moreover, the pro version is one-time purchase and affordable for most people. The functiona of this app is worth for me to spend a bit money to support the developers. However, it would be much better if there is a night mode background and more white sound options.',\n",
       "  26: \"This app is very useful and I recommend everyone to install this app. I had it installed a few weeks ago and it's really productive. Those who study over time or less time this app will be very useful. Especially no ads no bugs thus this is the best app I have ever seen.\",\n",
       "  27: 'If you are looking for an app that will help you concentrate on different daily priorities, I suggest this app, Forest. It is basically a timer that urges you to return to the app when you open another app that distracts you. Despite not having the pro, I could tell that it is entertaining to plant different and various sources of plants. In the pro, they also have the Tag Distribution to help you check which part you frequently work on and those that lacks your attention of. That is all( - -)>',\n",

I recommend forest for anyone who can't concentrate ^^\",\n",

You need to plant more trees and as if you plant you will get sweet fruit as well this app has really less ads it show me 1 or 2 ads In a day something it does this thing I also like alot about it and it also shows you the extera time you too more then you set the time for you must go for it❤️☺️',\n",
       "  30: 'NOT really 1 star :) Can you please make it so that once you finish a set work time eg 24minutes, that the break timer automatically starts. I hate having to select the break I want every time a session ends. It leaves me having to remember which session I am on and is it time for my short 5 minute break or my long 30 min break. We should be able to create custome sessions. 25m work, 5m break repeating 4 times followed by 29minute break. ALL these times should be customizable.',\n",

       " {0: \"I've been playing this game since 2016 and really enjoy it, but there are many glitches in the raids and cheaters in GO battles. I've encountered charge attack spam after 2 or 3 fast attacks, extra shield usage, and spam switching between pokemon. I've had many awesome battles that I've lost in, but its no fun when your team gets destroyed in seconds by cheaters. For raids, the clock runs out before the number is at 0 and my charge attack doesn't work when I click it. Please fix this!!\",\n",
       "  1: 'A very nice game. The idea of it is awesome. You have to walk a lot which is good for our health etc. The idea of gym battles is awesome and getting gym badges. Catching pokemon is also cool. It could improve more if the a.r mode was available even while walking. And u can make the pokemon fight, more interesting rather than just tapping. It would also improve if the pokemon at the right climatic conditions were present. E.G in rain, water pokemon should be more.Other than this it is excellent.',\n",
       "  2: \"If you want to play a game where you walk around and catch pokemon in the real world, this game is for you. If you want to use any of the other features of this game, such as to battle other players in the Go Battle League, I would not recommend this game. This game still has bugs that the developers have not addressed (bugs that have persisted for the past 2+ years). I play full loot MMO's where you can lose everything you have at the drop of a hat, and this game is far more frustrating. Many times you will find you lose in the Go Battle League due to technical glitches (happens 3-4 times daily). This game also has raiding, in which several players get together to battle a legendary/mythical pokemon and then have a chance to catch it. That mechanic works, but is more pay to win than anything else. The developer of this game communicates very poorly, and introduces new bugs, forget fixing old ones. This game also has many community-driven features (raiding for one), and yet has no community support.. meaning you cannot make friends or find friends within the game, and cannot communicate with anyone within the game. You are left trying to reach out to people IRL (doesn't go over well many times since Covid19), or finding a facebook group or discord group to find other players. This game is very much a cash grab, masked by a seemingly well polished game that really isn't as well polished as it looks once you dig into the core features.\",\n",

Now, battles are laggy, and coins are limited to 50/day (6/hr) no matter when you placed your mon in a gym. 50 coins isn't much considering cosmetics, extra raid passes and upgrades average 200 coins. Should have a way to recall your gym pokemon after 10hrs (50 coin time limit) Remote raiding is nice but game has become more of a cash grab :/\",\n",
