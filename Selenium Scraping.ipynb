It is affordable and sustainable as well. For the creators, great job! I have been using this app for 3 years and it hasn't failed me since. Suggestion though, create an extension that works like momentum, so the timer in my chrome won't go away when I click. Thanks!\",\n",
       "  1: \"Super cute and helpful! This has been helping me with my studying since I started using it - a lot of the time, I'll even go over the time I set for myself. I love seeing my little trees grow because I'm working hard! Having the reminders also helps to get me back into study mode. I really love this app!\",\n",
       "  2: 'Nice app but the only thing irritates me is premiership. Any time i want explore the app its asks me to take premium orelse it wont open. I mean you can only use the timer nothing else without premiership. If i have to use only timer why should i waste my mobile storage on this app I can use other app. I request the publisher to give features without premiership',\n",
       "  3: \"I like this app and find it useful for concentrating on specific tasks for a designated period of time, during which a virtual tree grows. It's satisfying to see a forest / garden at the end of the day. My only problem with the app is that the selection of plants to choose from is not great. The more recent ones are nice and have a lot of detail, but the earlier ones are quite cartoonish and unappealing.\",\n",
       "  4: 'So much helpful.... A great app to deal with phone addiction. Now I am a premium user. Definitely, the developers are working hard. This is by far the most productive app on play store and I am increasing my productivity day by day with you guys. Looking forward to plant a real 🎄! Great job guys!',\n",
       "  5: \"I've been using Forest since 2015 and it definitely helps prevent mindless usage of distracting apps. I consider paying for premium and other perks every so often a thank you to the developers for the many hours of productivity this app has helped me achieve. It's more than paid for itself. One feature I've found myself wanting lately would be to have custom app whitelists tied to the activity you've selected. So my work activity would be more strict than others for example.\",\n",
       "  6: 'This app is amazing. However, the devs have in the past removed features for free users in favour of making them paid. I currently am using the paid version, but for anyone using it free, just be aware of this. (Referring to the loss of app whitelisting in the free version)',\n",
       "  7: \"I would have given 5 stars, since this app is very helpful for concentrating! Only since the last update there seems to be a bug. I cannot see any statistics anymore, and none of my forests from the whole week or month. I can only see the actual day and when I try the other data's it's only loading forever but nothing happens. Can anyone help me with this?\",\n",
       "  8: \"Amazing App only had it for a few days and it's already helping with productivity. I would give it 5 stars however, when I go to start planting a tree I get a pop up saying I haven't allowed permissions for the app so I can't turn on deep focus. I have gone in settings and there is no permissions that I have turned off and no option to fix permissions directly in the app, make it a hastle. I Am looking to pay for the pro version, however there would be no point if I am unable to fix this issue.\",\n",
       "  9: \"I'm a new user, just downloaded this today and I like the app! The graphics are cute and refreshing, and I like the idea of planting a tree (or plant) by spending my time doing productive stuff. That's really creative (I give 5 stars to that! ;) But sadly though, there are a lot of good features only pro-user can use. :'( For now, I'm only dissatisfied with that. Thanks! :)\",\n",
       "  10: \"A lot of the more intuitive features are locked behind a paywall, as well as actually helping real forests, which was the main appeal for me. The basic version gives you some cute trees, basic analytics and white noise options, and it works pretty well to keep you from looking at your phone and guiding you back to the app. It's a fine app if you're looking for a basic focus timer.\",\n",
       "  11: 'Great App. However, there is a workaround. If on the lock screen I click on a whatsapp notification and then I am prompted to enter my password, I am bale to go directly into the app and that seems to by pass Forest. So maybe make that impossible to do and like increase the apps aggressiveness a bit? Otherwise no complaints love it!',\n",
       "  12: \"It's an ok app, but you can't play the ambient sounds while planting the tree, I had a sound unlocked but I could never play it while I studied, and some other advanced settings aren't easy to figure out either. Also, it would be nice to have at least a few achievements in the free version.\",\n",
       "  13: \"I really like this app so far! I do wish there were a few more choices for plants in the beginning, just so you can have them represent different tasks. Two is a little limited and it takes a lot of time (and focus!) to earn coins for other plants. But i guess that's also good motivation. Fun app for staying focused :)\",\n",
       "  14: 'I meet a problem while using the app.... In case of applying \"Allow List\" and using YouTube and then I select \" play video sound with screen off\" this feature is on new Xiaomi mobiles. What happens is ....the tree will be withered. I need you to solve this annoying problem',\n",
       "  15: \"I really like the idea of trees representing your focus hours. I even purchased the app so I can buy more tree species. But the app is so laggy. I have to press several time to change tags or tree types for example. The notification only works sometimes. And whenever I open the app, it's reloading instead of showing where I was last time. Sometimes my tree withers for no reasons. I really like the app so I hope future versions of the app will get better.\",\n",

       "  18: 'I have only been using this app for about a week now but it has already helped me focus on what I need to do. Also, I love the idea of the tree growing as I focus more on the important things. A really good app to build a habit of focusing.',\n",

I plant trees with my school friends a lot, and now all the trees I\\'ve ever planted as a group show up as dead. Another friend of mine is having the same problem, however an iPhone user friend is not having this problem. I hope they fix this issue, it is so sad to see all the trees I\\'ve planted together in this year turn to dead trees.',\n",
       "  20: \"Well I like the app and it truly helps me stay focused, combined with some time restriction methods it's good (although those ones are short times plus breaks), achievements are boring and not good enough, they try to make you pay for extra, but the app itself is not exciting enough to pay, the achievements are not really worth it and it's hard to unlock new trees even with pro version. No new campaigns are launched & collecting coins is not an easily achievable task, too hard to get new trees.\",\n",
       "  21: \"This app is literally the best focusing app, at least for me. It allows you to plant trees whenever you get focused. It's kinda like a game. Its not as boring as other focusing apps.\",\n",
       "  22: \"So much potential in one app. Adding interactions with the plants and trees just to relax or reflect, automatically setting a schedule to plant a tree and adding a pomodoro style timer are my suggestions. 4 stars because, somehow, I dislike the user interface especially the tags. It just doesn't suit ny tastes. Still great tho. Recommended for students⭐⭐⭐⭐\",\n",
       "  23: \"It does the job; not letting a plant die gives me enough incentive to not touch my phone. Also, I BOUGHT THE APP! If you are thinking of doing the same just to get trees, don't. You'd still need to earn coins to buy tree styles and you can't get time locked trees still!\",\n",
       "  24: 'Interesting way to gain focus. Moreover, the pro version is one-time purchase and affordable for most people. The functiona of this app is worth for me to spend a bit money to support the developers. However, it would be much better if there is a night mode background and more white sound options.',\n",
       "  25: \"This app is very useful and I recommend everyone to install this app. I had it installed a few weeks ago and it's really productive. Those who study over time or less time this app will be very useful. Especially no ads no bugs thus this is the best app I have ever seen.\",\n",
       "  26: 'If you are looking for an app that will help you concentrate on different daily priorities, I suggest this app, Forest. It is basically a timer that urges you to return to the app when you open another app that distracts you. Despite not having the pro, I could tell that it is entertaining to plant different and various sources of plants. In the pro, they also have the Tag Distribution to help you check which part you frequently work on and those that lacks your attention of. That is all( - -)>',\n",

I do have one suggestion - I like to plant trees when I go to bed, but the longest they grow for is 3 hours. I think the stopwatch shouldn't have a maximum time.\",\n",

The gamification of getting you to focus does a great job in getting you to do so by blocking other apps and allowing you to grow some cool trees and what not.

I understand that with an open world game, the maps themseles can make the game pretty hefty. Overall a decent game.\",\n",

The combat is amazing and I love how each character can have their own weapon class along with elemental/skill type!
