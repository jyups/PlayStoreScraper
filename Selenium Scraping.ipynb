It is affordable and sustainable as well. For the creators, great job! I have been using this app for 3 years and it hasn't failed me since. Suggestion though, create an extension that works like momentum, so the timer in my chrome won't go away when I click. Thanks!\",\n",

I love seeing my little trees grow because I'm working hard! Having the reminders also helps to get me back into study mode. I really love this app!\",\n",
       " 2: 'Nice app but the only thing irritates me is premiership. Any time i want explore the app its asks me to take premium orelse it wont open. I mean you can only use the timer nothing else without premiership. If i have to use only timer why should i waste my mobile storage on this app I can use other app. I request the publisher to give features without premiership',\n",
       " 3: \"I like this app and find it useful for concentrating on specific tasks for a designated period of time, during which a virtual tree grows. It's satisfying to see a forest / garden at the end of the day. My only problem with the app is that the selection of plants to choose from is not great. The more recent ones are nice and have a lot of detail, but the earlier ones are quite cartoonish and unappealing.\",\n",

This is by far the most productive app on play store and I am increasing my productivity day by day with you guys. Looking forward to plant a real 🎄! Great job guys!',\n",
       " 5: \"I've been using Forest since 2015 and it definitely helps prevent mindless usage of distracting apps. I consider paying for premium and other perks every so often a thank you to the developers for the many hours of productivity this app has helped me achieve. It's more than paid for itself. One feature I've found myself wanting lately would be to have custom app whitelists tied to the activity you've selected. So my work activity would be more strict than others for example.\",\n",
       " 6: 'This app is amazing. However, the devs have in the past removed features for free users in favour of making them paid. I currently am using the paid version, but for anyone using it free, just be aware of this. (Referring to the loss of app whitelisting in the free version)',\n",

I have gone in settings and there is no permissions that I have turned off and no option to fix permissions directly in the app, make it a hastle. I Am looking to pay for the pro version, however there would be no point if I am unable to fix this issue.\",\n",

The basic version gives you some cute trees, basic analytics and white noise options, and it works pretty well to keep you from looking at your phone and guiding you back to the app. It's a fine app if you're looking for a basic focus timer.\",\n",

If on the lock screen I click on a whatsapp notification and then I am prompted to enter my password, I am bale to go directly into the app and that seems to by pass Forest. So maybe make that impossible to do and like increase the apps aggressiveness a bit? Otherwise no complaints love it!',\n",

The graphics are cute and refreshing, and I like the idea of planting a tree (or plant) by spending my time doing productive stuff.

       " 13: \"I really like this app so far! I do wish there were a few more choices for plants in the beginning, just so you can have them represent different tasks. Two is a little limited and it takes a lot of time (and focus!) to earn coins for other plants. But i guess that's also good motivation. Fun app for staying focused :)\",\n",

       " 15: \"I really like the idea of trees representing your focus hours. I even purchased the app so I can buy more tree species. But the app is so laggy. I have to press several time to change tags or tree types for example. The notification only works sometimes. And whenever I open the app, it's reloading instead of showing where I was last time. Sometimes my tree withers for no reasons. I really like the app so I hope future versions of the app will get better.\",\n",

I plant trees with my school friends a lot, and now all the trees I\\'ve ever planted as a group show up as dead. Another friend of mine is having the same problem, however an iPhone user friend is not having this problem. I hope they fix this issue, it is so sad to see all the trees I\\'ve planted together in this year turn to dead trees.',\n",
       " 20: \"Well I like the app and it truly helps me stay focused, combined with some time restriction methods it's good (although those ones are short times plus breaks), achievements are boring and not good enough, they try to make you pay for extra, but the app itself is not exciting enough to pay, the achievements are not really worth it and it's hard to unlock new trees even with pro version. No new campaigns are launched & collecting coins is not an easily achievable task, too hard to get new trees.\",\n",
       " 21: \"So much potential in one app. Adding interactions with the plants and trees just to relax or reflect, automatically setting a schedule to plant a tree and adding a pomodoro style timer are my suggestions. 4 stars because, somehow, I dislike the user interface especially the tags. It just doesn't suit ny tastes. Still great tho. Recommended for students⭐⭐⭐⭐\",\n",

       " 23: 'Interesting way to gain focus. Moreover, the pro version is one-time purchase and affordable for most people. The functiona of this app is worth for me to spend a bit money to support the developers. However, it would be much better if there is a night mode background and more white sound options.',\n",

It is basically a timer that urges you to return to the app when you open another app that distracts you.
