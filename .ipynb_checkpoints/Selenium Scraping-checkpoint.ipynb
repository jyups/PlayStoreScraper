Suggestion though, create an extension that works like momentum, so the timer in my chrome won't go away when I click. Thanks!\",\n",

I would give it 5 stars however, when I go to start planting a tree I get a pop up saying I haven't allowed permissions for the app so I can't turn on deep focus. I have gone in settings and there is no permissions that I have turned off and no option to fix permissions directly in the app, make it a hastle. I Am looking to pay for the pro version, however there would be no point if I am unable to fix this issue.\",\n",

The graphics are cute and refreshing, and I like the idea of planting a tree (or plant) by spending my time doing productive stuff.

       "  10: \"A lot of the more intuitive features are locked behind a paywall, as well as actually helping real forests, which was the main appeal for me. The basic version gives you some cute trees, basic analytics and white noise options, and it works pretty well to keep you from looking at your phone and guiding you back to the app. It's a fine app if you're looking for a basic focus timer.\",\n",
       "  11: 'Nice app but the only thing irritates me is premiership. Any time i want explore the app its asks me to take premium orelse it wont open. I mean you can only use the timer nothing else without premiership. If i have to use only timer why should i waste my mobile storage on this app I can use other app. I request the publisher to give features without premiership',\n",

If on the lock screen I click on a whatsapp notification and then I am prompted to enter my password, I am bale to go directly into the app and that seems to by pass Forest. So maybe make that impossible to do and like increase the apps aggressiveness a bit? Otherwise no complaints love it!',\n",

Also, it would be nice to have at least a few achievements in the free version.\",\n",
       "  14: \"I really like this app so far! I do wish there were a few more choices for plants in the beginning, just so you can have them represent different tasks. Two is a little limited and it takes a lot of time (and focus!) to earn coins for other plants. But i guess that's also good motivation. Fun app for staying focused :)\",\n",

I have to press several time to change tags or tree types for example. The notification only works sometimes. And whenever I open the app, it's reloading instead of showing where I was last time. Sometimes my tree withers for no reasons. I really like the app so I hope future versions of the app will get better.\",\n",

Another friend of mine is having the same problem, however an iPhone user friend is not having this problem. I hope they fix this issue, it is so sad to see all the trees I\\'ve planted together in this year turn to dead trees.',\n",

No new campaigns are launched & collecting coins is not an easily achievable task, too hard to get new trees.\",\n",

It just doesn't suit ny tastes. Still great tho. Recommended for students⭐⭐⭐⭐\",\n",

Plain and simple, You make a lot of money for something you put little effort in supporting. Not everyone can use a keyboard and require controllers or even specialized controller.

I've encountered charge attack spam after 2 or 3 fast attacks, extra shield usage, and spam switching between pokemon. I've had many awesome battles that I've lost in, but its no fun when your team gets destroyed in seconds by cheaters. For raids, the clock runs out before the number is at 0 and my charge attack doesn't work when I click it. Please fix this!!\",\n",
       "  1: 'A very nice game. The idea of it is awesome. You have to walk a lot which is good for our health etc. The idea of gym battles is awesome and getting gym badges. Catching pokemon is also cool. It could improve more if the a.r mode was available even while walking. And u can make the pokemon fight, more interesting rather than just tapping. It would also improve if the pokemon at the right climatic conditions were present. E.G in rain, water pokemon should be more.Other than this it is excellent.',\n",
       "  2: \"If you want to play a game where you walk around and catch pokemon in the real world, this game is for you. If you want to use any of the other features of this game, such as to battle other players in the Go Battle League, I would not recommend this game. This game still has bugs that the developers have not addressed (bugs that have persisted for the past 2+ years). I play full loot MMO's where you can lose everything you have at the drop of a hat, and this game is far more frustrating. Many times you will find you lose in the Go Battle League due to technical glitches (happens 3-4 times daily). This game also has raiding, in which several players get together to battle a legendary/mythical pokemon and then have a chance to catch it. That mechanic works, but is more pay to win than anything else. The developer of this game communicates very poorly, and introduces new bugs, forget fixing old ones. This game also has many community-driven features (raiding for one), and yet has no community support.. meaning you cannot make friends or find friends within the game, and cannot communicate with anyone within the game. You are left trying to reach out to people IRL (doesn't go over well many times since Covid19), or finding a facebook group or discord group to find other players. This game is very much a cash grab, masked by a seemingly well polished game that really isn't as well polished as it looks once you dig into the core features.\",\n",
       "  3: \"I liked it a lot when it first came out, incubators dropped from poke stops, there was noticeably less lag, and there was no glitchy AR adventure system. Now, battles are laggy, and coins are limited to 50/day (6/hr) no matter when you placed your mon in a gym. 50 coins isn't much considering cosmetics, extra raid passes and upgrades average 200 coins. Should have a way to recall your gym pokemon after 10hrs (50 coin time limit) Remote raiding is nice but game has become more of a cash grab :/\",\n",
       "  4: \"Still enjoy it to this day, however I must say that when you are a casual player, no raids, gyms n such, because you have to little time to invest in that. The lack of healing items you get throughout, required for say example battling team Rocket that have pokemon of freaking 6000+cp is a little disappointing. Other than that it's still a good lil game.\",\n",
       "  5: \"The game is fun, but I am disappointed that they chosee to reduce the proximity circles for pokestops and gyms. During the pandemic, it was nice to get out and be social without being at arm's reach of 20 other people. The remote raid feature is also nice, but expensive. I hate having to use a remote pass because the gym is on private property or in someone's backyard. Edit: Happy they put the proximity back to expanded state.\",\n",
       "  6: \"I loved this game, but for some reason, it just randomly stopped working without any warning. Basically, it crashes 5 minutes max after it loads. It takes about half an hour for me to successfully feed my buddy, pyroar. For this I can't give it any more than 2 stars.\",\n",
       "  7: \"Constant lag issues in GBL causing losses i.e. freezing completely. Issues with losing raid passes/being kicked out of raid not being able to rejoin. Remote raid passes should be merged with premiums, and able to be purchased in packs. For the amount of pay-to-play this game has it is amazing they don't fix these problems. Added one more star because they extended spin distance. PLEASE allow us to exchange fast tms for charge tms. Even 2:1 would be helpful.\",\n",
       "  8: 'It\\'s a great app for being a realistic pokemon trainer.
